                        <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
                        <p>Hi! We've created this privacy policy to explain how we collect, use, disclose and protect your information; including any nonpublic personal information.</p>

                        <p>This policy applies to information we collect when you use our website (collectively, "Services") or otherwise interact with us as described below. We may change this privacy policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy, and in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to the homepages of our website or by sending you an email notification).</p>

                        <p>We encourage you to review the privacy policy whenever you interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. This privacy policy applies to the Services provided by {{$siteName}} (“we” or “us”).</p>

                        <h4>2. Collection of Information</h4>
                        <p>When you create an {{$siteName}} account, we may collect information, including non-public personal information about you from non-affiliated third party service providers in order to verify your identity and for fraud prevention, including your prior addresses and names.</p>
                        <p>We may collect information you provide to us, such as your name, email address and any other information you choose to provide. For example, we may collect such information if you request an invite to join Quantum Finance or if you enter into any contest or promotion.</p>

                        <h4>3. Cookies</h4>
                        <p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.</p>

                        <h4>4. Security</h4>
